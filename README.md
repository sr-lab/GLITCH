GLITCH is a technology-agnostic framework that enables automated detection of IaC smells. GLITCH allows polyglot smell detection by transforming IaC scripts into an intermediate representation, on which different smell detectors can be defined. GLITCH currently supports the detection of nine different security smells [1, 2] and nine design & implementation smells [3] in scripts written in Puppet, Ansible, or Chef.



## Paper and Academic Usage
"[GLITCH: Automated Polyglot Security Smell Detection in Infrastructure as Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14371)" is the main paper that describes the implementation of security smells in GLITCH. It also presents a large-scale empirical study  that analyzes security smells on three large datasets containing 196,755 IaC scripts and 12,281,251 LOC.

## Installation

To install run:
```
python -m pip install -e .
```

To use the tool for Chef you also need Ruby and its Ripper package installed.

### Poetry

To install GLITCH using Poetry, run:
```
poetry install
```

**WARNING**: _For now, the GLITCH VSCode extension does not function if GLITCH 
is installed via Poetry. Since Poetry uses virtual environments it does not 
create a binary for GLITCH available in the user's PATH, which is required for 
the VSCode extension._

## Usage

To explore all available options, use the command:
```
glitch --help
```

To analyze a file or folder and retrieve CSV results, use the following command:
```
glitch --tech (chef|puppet|ansible|terraform) --csv --config PATH_TO_CONFIG PATH_TO_FILE_OR_FOLDER
```

If you want to consider the module structure you can add the flag ```--module```.

### Poetry

If GLITCH was installed using Poetry, execute GLITCH commands as follows:
```
poetry run glitch --help
```

Alternatively, you can use `poetry shell`:
```
poetry shell
glitch --help
```

## Tests

To run the tests for GLITCH go to the folder ```glitch``` and run:
```
python -m unittest discover tests
```

## Configs

New configs can be created with the same structure as the ones found in the folder ```configs```.

## Documentation

More information can be found in [GLITCH's documentation](https://github.com/sr-lab/GLITCH/wiki).

## VSCode extension

GLITCH has a Visual Studio Code extension which is available [here](https://github.com/sr-lab/GLITCH/tree/main/vscode-extension/glitch).
